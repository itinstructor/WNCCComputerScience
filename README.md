  - This class uses OER and Instructor resources contained in the Python folder.
  - Python Chapters is the folder which contains the book/framework used for the class.
- INFO-1510 Intro to Robotics
  - This class is entirely instructor created.
  - Scratch, Arduino C
- INFO-2350 Intro to Computer Science
  - This class uses OER and Instructor resources contained in the Python, Java, and C++ folders.  
  - Python Activities, Java Chapters, C++ Chapters are the folders which contain the book/framework for the class.
- INFO-2355 Computer Science 1
  - This class uses OER and Instructor resources contained in the Python, Java, and C++ folders.

## Purpose

I am an Information Technology Instructor at [Western Nebraska Community College](https://www.wncc.edu). I teach Information Technology, CyberSecurity and Computer Science. Best job ever!

This repository contains some of the resources for WNCC [Computer Science](https://www.wncc.edu/academics/programs-of-study/computer-sciences) Courses. We cover Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Data Science, Java, Arduino C, C++, and SQL.

In the current software development environment, it is important to learn more than one language. Understanding the concepts and solving the problem (computational thinking) is important, not memorizing the syntax. Learning more than one language at a time helps generalize programming concepts and problem solving at a higher level of understanding and synthesis.
